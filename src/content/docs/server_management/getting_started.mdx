## Guided Setup

<Steps>
1. Invite the bot to your server
    <LinkCard title="Invite Bloxlink"
        href="https://blox.link/invite" 
        description="Invite link for the Bloxlink bot." 
        target="_blank"
    />

2. Use the /setup command 
    > *This will guide you through setting up your nickname template, verified role name, and even link a group!*

    <details>
    <summary> Used the bot before? </summary>
        In the past the bot would create your group roles for you in Discord. It does not do that
        anymore, so if you want that you will need to use the `/bind group` command described below instead.
    </details>

    :::caution
    You can only set your verified role name to "Verified" through setup right now. If you wish to use another
    role, please see the manual configuration section.
    :::
    
3. That's it!
</Steps>

## Manual Configuration
Follow this if you want to manually do what /setup does 

<Steps>
1. Invite the bot to your server
    <LinkCard title="Invite Bloxlink"
        href="https://blox.link/invite" 
        description="Invite link for the Bloxlink bot." 
        target="_blank"
    />

2. Head to the server dashboard & select your server
    <LinkCard title="Server dashboard"
        href="https://blox.link/dashboard/user/servers" 
        description="The list of servers you are an admin in." 
        target="_blank"
    />
</Steps>

### Set the nickname template

<Steps>
1. Head to the "Verification" tab of your server dashboard <br />
    *TODO: add an image*

2. Insert the desired nickname template using the options listed, or put in what you wish <br />
    *TODO: Add a link to list of valid nickname variables on the site somewhere*
</Steps>

### Set the verified role 
<Steps>
1. Head to the "Verification" tab of your server dashboard <br />
    *TODO: add an image*

2. Locate the "Verified Role" option, and choose the role you wish to use <br />
    *TODO: Add an image* <br />
    > If this is a new server, create the role you wish to use before getting to this point!
</Steps>

### Connect your group
This is what we call a **bind**, and is how we have Bloxlink assign any roles other than the 
Verified and Unverified roles!

These cannot be created from the website yet, so we need to go back to Discord first.
<Steps>
1. Head to your server on Discord
2. Type in `/bind group` and choose the command from the list <br />
    *TODO: Insert image*
3. Type in your group ID to the `group_id` option
    <details>
        <summary> Get your group ID </summary>
        Your group ID is the string of numbers inside your group URL.

        For example, with the group URL of `https://www.roblox.com/communities/3587262/Bloxlink-Space`, the 
        group ID is `3587262`.
    </details>
4. Choose the `bind_mode`, the default to use is `Bind all current and future group roles`
5. Choose if you want the bot to create your group ranks as Discord roles<br/>
    > By default, the bot will use any role that has the <u>same name</u> as the Roblox group rank.<br/>
    > If you choose not create them now, the bot will create the roles as it needs them.<br/>
6. That's it!
</Steps>
