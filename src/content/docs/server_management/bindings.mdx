## What are binds anyway?
Binds are what allow the bot to give people Discord role based on something they own, are, or are not, on Roblox.
This could be a group rank, ownership of a badge, gamepass, or other marketplace/catalog item.

## Creating binds
See the various tabs below to learn how to make some binds. These are all commands to use in your Discord server.
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Group (Automatic)">
        ##### Information
        This bind type will have the bot automatically hand out Discord roles to users based on the linked group.
        The Discord roles that Bloxlink will give <u>must exactly match</u> your Roblox Group names.

        ##### Making the bind
        See the ["Getting Started"](../getting_started/#connect-your-group) guide to create an
        automatically updating group binding.
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Group (Manual)">
        ##### Information
        This bind type will make it so that you can give Discord roles based on a variety of group membership options.
        These options include:
        - Being in (or not in) the group
        - Having a specific rank
        - Being within a range of ranks
        - Being above, or below, a specific rank

        :::note
        The bot uses the terms `role`, `roleset`, and `rank` interchangeably to refer to a Roblox group role.
        We call it a group `rank` here because that is what they were originally called, and is most known
        by the community as such.
        :::


        ##### Making the bind
        <Steps>
            1. Type in `/bind group` and choose the command from the list
            2. Type in your group ID to the `group_id` option
                <details>
                    <summary> Get your group ID </summary>

                    Your group ID is the string of numbers inside your group URL.

                    For example, with the group URL of `https://www.roblox.com/communities/3587262/Bloxlink-Space`, the
                    group ID is `3587262`.
                </details>

            3. Choose the `bind_mode` of "Choose specific group roles"

                ![Choose specific group roles bind mode option](../../../assets/binds/group-mode-csgr.png)

            4. Click the `Create new bind` button on the menu that the bot posts

                ![Page menu buttons](../../../assets/binds/create-new-bind-button.png)

            5. Select what is required to receive the role(s) you wish to give.

                There are six options to choose from:
                - "Rank must match exactly"
                - "Rank must be greater than or equal to"
                - "Rank must be less then or equal to"
                - "Rank must be between two rolesets"
                - "User MUST be a member of this group"
                - "User must NOT be a member of this group"

                <br />

            6. Select your Discord role(s) to give, and group ranks if applicable.

                Or, you can optionally have the bot make you a role with the "Create role" button.

                <details>
                    <summary>I don't see the Discord role I want!</summary>

                    The selection box only shows 25 roles by default, but if you want to choose a role that is not listed,
                    you can type in the box to search for a role!

                    ![Example showing how typing "Verified" into the box returns the verified role](../../../assets/binds/discord-role-search.png)
                </details>

            7. That's all! ðŸŽ‰

                You can either click `Create new bind` to make some more binds, or click
                `Publish` for the bot to save your binds.

                <Aside type="note">
                    The bot may say "This interaction failed" when you click publish.
                    This is normal, the bot will edit the message when it finishes saving.
                    Do not spam the publish button. If it takes over 1 minute to edit, please contact support.
