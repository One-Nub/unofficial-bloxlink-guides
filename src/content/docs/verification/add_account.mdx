        1. Click your Discord username in the top right of the site
        2. Click the "Dashboard" button in the drop down
        
        <LinkCard

        TODO: Still waiting on images lol

    6. Authorize Bloxlink with your Roblox Account

        Click "Next", then after reading what Bloxlink requests access to, click "Confirm and Give Access" at
        the bottom of the page.

        After confirming, you will be taken back to Bloxlink's site to continue.

    7. Select what servers you want to use this account in

        No servers are selected by default - selected servers will be outlined in green.

        At the bottom of the list you can choose to "Select all servers" as well.

        <details>
            <summary>I don't see any servers here!</summary>

            This probably means you are accidentally using a different Discord account in your browser from 
            what you normally use!

            Head to the [common issues](/verification/common_issues#i-dont-see-any-servers-to-select) page to 
            learn how to fix this.

    9. You did it! üéâ
