        1. Make sure you are using the right Roblox account then click `Next` 

            ![Roblox authorize account page](../../../assets/verify/5-roblox-continue.png)
        
            <details>

        2. After reading what Bloxlink requests access to, click the blue `Confirm and Give Access` button at
        the bottom of the page.

        After confirming, you will be taken back to Bloxlink's site to continue.

    7. Select what servers you want to use this account in

        No servers are selected by default - selected servers will be outlined in green.

        ![Example of a selected server outlined in green, and one that is not](../../../assets/verify/7-selected-deselected.png)

        At the bottom of the list you can choose to `Select all servers` as well.

        <details>
            <summary>I don't see any servers here!</summary>

            This probably means you are accidentally using a different Discord account in your browser from 
            what you normally use!
