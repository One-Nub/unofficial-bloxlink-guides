So you want to use a different account... Okay! This will teach you how to switch your account in some specific
servers.


<Steps>
1. If you have not already, link another account with Bloxlink.

    If you're not sure how to do this, see the [add an account](/verification/add_account) guide!

2. From the <a href="https://blox.link/dashboard/user" target="_blank">user dashboard</a>, click on the account you want to use.

3. Select the servers that you wish to use the account in.

    By default, all the servers shown are selected (outlined in green). Be sure to deselect any servers you do 
    not want the account to be used in.

4. Click the `Confirm` button at the bottom of the page.

5. Head to the server(s) on Discord that you changed your account in, and use `/verify` or the verification channel button.

6. That's it!
</Steps>

    Try waiting up to 15 minutes, and then try using the `/verify` command or the verification channel button.

    If you are still having issues after then, please head to the [Bloxlink support server](https://blox.link/support) for some help.
