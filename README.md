Uses a git hook to scrub EXIF data from images. This is located under the [.git-hooks](/.git-hooks) directory.
Requires [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) to be installed & the `git config core.hooksPath .git-hooks` setting to be set.
This moves the hooks path from inside .git to a root-level ".git-hooks" folder in the repo.
